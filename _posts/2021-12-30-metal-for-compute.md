title: "Metal for Compute"

**Note**: This blog post is a Work in Progress.

## before we get started

Head over to Apple's [getting started with metal-cpp guide](https://developer.apple.com/metal/cpp/) and follow the
instruction in the section titled "**Step 1. Prepare your Mac**".
Additionally, make sure to also follow the part of the instruction that describe how to use metal-cpp as a single
header include (section titled "**Metal-cpp single header alternative**") in a project.

We will be using Xcode for development, I used version 13.2.1 (13C100).
