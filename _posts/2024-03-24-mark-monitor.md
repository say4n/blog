title: Who registers your domain names?
---

Most of us register and renew our domain names through various registrars such as Namecheap, Godaddy, the [late Google domains](https://support.google.com/domains/answer/13689670) etc. 
But how do the fortune 500 companies do it? I am glad you asked!

This is where companies like [Markmonitor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markmonitor) come into the picture. Their services include:

> software intended to protect corporate brands from Internet counterfeiting, fraud, piracy, and cybersquatting

Markmonitor has an impressive clientele involving the likes of companies such as Amazon, Google, Akamai, Alibaba, Baidu etc!

Essentially, think of Markmonitor as a service that reminds you to pay for your domain names before they expire so that you aren't bullied into someone on the interwebs squatting your domain name.
This is quite amusing to me as an individual but it is a sensible service nonetheless that benefits corporations.

I still find it quite hard to wrap my head around this. :)
