title: "`tar` is fun?"
---

Have you ever wondered why the unix command `tar` is a cryptic mess and everytime you need to use it you need to head back to the man page to look them up?
Well fear no more -- you could just remember these mnemonic flags instead and make your life easier!

```
$ file archive.tar.gz
archive.tar.gz: gzip compressed data, last modified: Sun Dec 24 13:42:15 2023, from Unix, original size modulo 2^32 1372672
```

## list contents of an archive

Use `wtf`: what the fuck is in that archive? 

```shell
$ tar wtf archive.tar.gz
- 8<-
```

## extract the archive

Use `pfx`: please fucking extract the archive!

```shell
$ tar pfx archive.tar.gz
- 8<-
```
